<h1> GET vs POST </h1>
<h2> GET </h2>
<p>1. Used to retrieve information. </p>
<p>2. Data is sent via query string. </p>

<p>4. Limited amount of data can be sent </p>
<p> To summarize GET request are for retrieving information, a page. Basically there are no side effects on the backend. There shouldn't be anything being created or deleted or updated. The client side sends a request to retrieve some information and can also send some parameters which are visible in the query string. These parameters are only used for sorting or filtering out info and no permanent changes are made on the backend.</p>
